## What I did in this test...

- Bootstrapped Next.js project with `create-next-app` 

- Planned website structure based on Next.js App Router's file organization

- Learned and used Material UI to create the layout of the page

- Learned and used React-spring/web for parallax layers and write animation.

- Installed WordPress using [Local](https://localwp.com/), then installed 4 plugins in WordPress: Advanced Custom Fields, WPGraphQL, WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Field and Duplicator

- Created Field Groups and Post Types of "Articles" and "Capabilities" and found out that showing data in posts created in ACF requires an paid ACF Pro version (maybe I'm wrong). Currently it only shows default content in field groups.

## Current result

- Built homepage with animation

- Struggling in getting queries in WpGraphQL

- Learning Apollo Client

## Run this project

`npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser, best results are in 1366x765 and 360x765.

## Front-end render issues
- Best view in `1366x756`. Some spacing issue in `360x765`. Parallex layers from React-spring cause spacing problems in different viewpoint. 
- Sometimes the fonts don't render properly but refresh would fix it.
